Facing the problem of too many separate systems? Or manual processes and workflows? Calling for the creation of one unified system to fix them all is often a strong temptation, but usually an unwise one for the following reasons:

##### One system to fail them all
Unified systems are usually built in a monolithic architecture, which basically means a single point of failure such that if one portion of the system bottlenecks or fails, the entire system will fail.

Need to make a specific change to an unified system? That’ll be really difficult due to the dependencies and need to ensure the rest of the system is unaffected.

##### Slow development cycles
Such systems are usually massive projects with the scope constantly changing and creeping especially as development and even requirement gathering take such a long time that often processes and requirements change along the way.

Making changes on a monolithic system is also extremely difficult and slow as there are multiple dependencies to account for with every change, this can also lead to security vulnerabilities as the technology behind these systems become outdated.

##### Performance issues
Such systems tend to be slow and unable to scale for more users as the infrastructure is shared by multiple components within the same system creating bottlenecks

There are also many other technical drawbacks to monolithic systems such that we highly recommend not relying on unified / monolithic systems as a magic bullet to solve your organisation’s issues.

Instead, look towards narrowing down the scope of your problems and building specific small solutions for these problems that can communicate with other solutions. Read more about system design principles to understand how your IT solution should be structured for more effective problem-solving.
