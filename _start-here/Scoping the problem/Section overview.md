## Scoping the Problem

The first step to any system modernisation plan is clarifying the problem solved by that plan. We aren't into modernisation or digitisation just to create a fancy new cloud system, the end result has to be something that solves public sector problems and creates impact for public officers and the public!

Hence we should always first ask the question: what problem are we solving with this system?

Massive government agencies and multiple stakeholders have a multitude of problems they want to solve. However, you can't solve everything all at once. Figure out what are the underlying factors or top problems that should be addressed first.

There will be massive pressure to solve everybody's problems â€“ but that often results in none of their problems being solved, or the solution becoming a problem in itself as the system becomes unwieldly and massively complex.

#### Figuring out what parts of the problem requires other solutions

New systems are often the called the "magic bullet" that can fix all your problems, but the fact is that some problems require other solutions. For example unwieldly processes or templates may simply need to be trimmed and relooked, or obselete policies may need to be re-written. Simply digitising such problematic processes or policies will result in a situation of garbage in, garbage out...
