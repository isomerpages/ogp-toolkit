In *Leading Without Authority*, Keith Ferrazi writes, "“Professional relationships must be proactively and authentically developed with the people on our teams. This is the new competency of collaboration and productivity. It is critical to getting things done, more quickly.”

With this in mind, effective change management should account for the following: 

##### 1. Understanding the context and culture of an organisation 


How does it generally respond to change? Is this the same across all teams? Or are there certain ‘hot spots’ for culture that are more influential than others? 

How has it traditionally responded to change? When was the last time a similar initiative was attempted, and how was that received? How do you see that having an impact on your current attempt to facilitate a new change? 

##### 2. Identifying your points of leverage 

As individuals, we often have less influence than we realise. Therefore, we need to know who we can mobilise in order to scale our influence. 
These can be the right members of upper management (relying on authority), or longstanding members of an organisation (relying on relationships and soft power), or those who are perceived as those who know what they’re doing (relying on merit/proven competence). 

It could also be a mix, depending on what an organisation responds better to. Essentially, you need to rally those who can go on to rally others on your behalf. 


##### 3. Having clarity on your change management process 

Typically, getting buy-in always takes time. Important to note that getting buy-in is not the same as building consensus. You are not trying to come to an agreement with someone based on a mutually shared agenda → Everyone has a different agenda by default, so this can derail you from your goals. 

Rather, time should be spent on the following: 

*  Communicating → Where are you going, and why? What is the role that everyone has to play in this? How are you trying to meet the needs of your team, and why do you think this matters to them? 
*  Sense-checking your proposal → What are you trying to fix and does it really need to be fixed? How can you involve your organisation in discussions so that individuals feel as though they are part of the process? That their views matter and count for something?
*  Making visible your own biases and blindspots → Did you make any wrong assumptions? If you did, how can you show your stakeholders that you are learning and adjusting? This is about trust-building: making it transparent how you are not simply doing what you think is best.
