Congratulations, so your director has given you the mandate to pilot a new project, streamline certain internal processes, or perhaps even transform your entire department's tech stack. But as you start trying to do this, you might find yourself coming up against  certain obstacles. 

There might be those who think your merit is unproven, those who are resistant to change because they've gotten used to a particular way of doing things. Or even those who simply want you to fail. 

Specifically in the context of organisations like the Singapore Public Service, senior management can be a useful point of leverage in such instances (ref. Reinventing Organizations). 

Change management methodologies often emphasise the importance of buy-in, but this may not always be possible or effective. 

Keep in mind that you’re taking a ‘toolbox’ approach, nudging at different levers, assessing the results, and constantly refining how you’re choosing to make headway. 

Directors/upper management can be valuable partners in rallying teams across these respective levels:

* Fellow directors in other departments, whose teams will be involved in the change you’re trying to make 
* Joining your engagements with others at staff level to lend their authority + more importantly show the commitment of leadership to navigating this change effectively
* Influencing executive leadership – specifically for managing expectations, securing buy-in, navigating political considerations, advocating for staffing needs, etc. 

Remember: your director might have given you the mandate. But don't just ask what you are allowed to do. Ask your director how they too would be willing to get involved to back you up.
