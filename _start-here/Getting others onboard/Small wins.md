Creating a proof of concept will be the central tenet of any change management strategy within the Singapore Public Service. 

##### This serves several objectives:

1. Mitigates the risk of implementing a solution at scale, only to realise that itâ€™s not viable 
2. Allows for necessary changes before implementation at scale 
3. Validating the need for the original proposed solution, and showing that it can be done, in order facilitate stakeholder buy-in 
4. Demonstrate prudent use of taxpayer monies 

So whenever you're involved in implementing any kind of transformation, however small or large, consider how you can do so incrementally. Resist the temptation to try and fix everything at once.
