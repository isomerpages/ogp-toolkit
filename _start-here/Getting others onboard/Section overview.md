### **Getting people onboard to this idea**

You'd think that as long as we have a good idea, others are likely to both support and follow – but that isn't the case. Often, our ideas do not speak for themselves, and we'd have to undergo the journey of rallying stakeholders, get teams to buy in, and manage the process of change that is required for any kind of organisational transformation to take place. 

In this section, we will cover 3 main aspects of getting team members onboard: 

##### 1. Change management

Understanding the culture and context of your organisation, and the steps you need to take in order to bring everyone along for the ride. 

##### 2. Role of the director/upper management

How can you leverage on different members of your team – especially senior management – to navigate your organisation's culture and bureaucracy in order to execute effectively? 

##### 3. Small wins 

How can you create a proof of concept that will win over your stakeholders, and allow you to iterate while spending public funds prudently?
