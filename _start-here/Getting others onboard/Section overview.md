### **Getting people onboard to this idea**

Many of us believe that as long as we have a good idea, others will be likely to both support and follow. This isn't always true. Often, our ideas do not speak for themselves, and there is a journey to undertake in order to rally stakeholders, get teams to buy in, and manage the process of change that is required for any kind of organisational transformation to take place. 

In this section, we will cover 3 main aspects of getting team members onboard: 

##### 1. Change management

Understanding the culture and context of your organisation, and the steps you need to take in order to bring everyone along for the ride. 

##### 2. Role of the director/upper management

How can you leverage different members of your team, especially senior management, to navigate your organisation's culture and bureaucracy in order to execute effectively? 

##### 3. Small wins 

How can you create a proof of concept that will win over your stakeholders, and allow you to iterate while spending public funds prudently?
