## The 5 Year Plan

System development and modernisation is known to take notoriously long, and often what is planned only materialises after 5 years or more. But does it have to happen this way?

Long timelines are often due to poor problem scoping, process design, unclear tender requirements, and vendor management. These can snowball into massive, complicated systems which require such lengths of time to build that when it comes time to deploy, which initial underlying needs and processes have already changed!
