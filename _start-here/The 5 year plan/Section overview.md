## The 5 Year Plan

System development and modernisation is known to take notoriously long, and often what is planned only materialises after 5 years or more... But does it have to happen this way?

Long timelines are often due to poor problem scoping, process design, tender requirements writing, and vendor management. These snowball into massive, complicated systems which often require such lengths of time to build â€“ by which initial underlying needs and processes have already changed by the point of deployment!
