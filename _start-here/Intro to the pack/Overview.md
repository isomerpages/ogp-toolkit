## Pack overview

Welcome to the **OneUnifiedSystem Starter Pack**! This is an open resource for all public officers.

#### What is this starter pack for?

Many agencies are looking to modernise their legacy systems. This is daunting for any public officer tasked with this challenge, especially in larger agencies with countless complex workflows, where officers often aren't equipped with the relevant experience for such digitalisation.

Typically, this leads to a great deal of confusion and difficulty in making sense of what is required to effectively solve the agency's problems. It doesn't help either when there are many stakeholders involved who may not understand the benefits of such modernisation, or what it really takes to make it happen.

'_One unified system_' is a catchphrase that officers often use in their tenders, but what does that mean? Is it the best approach? Where does one start? How do you make a plan? What are some best practices? What does a useful, well-written tender look like?

This **OneUnifiedSystem starter pack** is meant to help the layman officer make sense of IT systems, tech procurement, design principles, and change management; as well as tap on tools, frameworks, and the experiences of other agencies to set up their modernisation efforts for success.
