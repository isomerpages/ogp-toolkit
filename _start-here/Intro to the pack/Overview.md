## Pack overview

Welcome to the **OneUnifiedSystem Starter Pack**! This is an open resource to all public officers.

#### What is this starter pack for?

Many agencies are looking to modernize their legacy systems. This is daunting for any public officer tasked with this challenge, especially in large agencies with a large number of complex workflows and officers often aren't equipped with relevant experience for such digistlisation.

This leads to a great deal of confusion and difficulty making sense of what is required to effectively solve the agency's problems, and it doesn't help that there are so many stakeholders involved who may not understand the need and benefits of such modernisation.

The term _one unified system_ is often a catchphrase that officers use in their tenders, but what does that mean? Is that the best approach? Where do I start? How do I make a plan? What are some best practices? How do I write a good tender?

The **One Unified System starter pack** is meant to the layman officer to make sense of IT systems, tech procurement, design principles and change management, tap on tools and frameworks to set up their modernisation efforts for success.

#### What you'll get out of this

- Learn best practices for tech procurement, systems design, digitalisation / modernisation
- Pick up tools and methods to frame and scope your problem
- Make sense of underlying processes for modernisation
