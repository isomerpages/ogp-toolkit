## Pack overview

Welcome to the **OneUnifiedSystem Starter Pack**! This is an open resource to all public officers.

#### What is this starter pack for?

Many agencies are looking to modernize their legacy systems. This is daunting for any public officer tasked with this challenge, especially in larger agencies with many complex workflows â€“ and where officers often aren't equipped with the relevant experience for such digitalisation.

This leads to a great deal of confusion and difficulty in making sense of what is required to effectively solve the agency's problems. It doesn't help when there are so many stakeholders involved who may not understand the needs and benefits of such modernisation.

'_One unified system_' is a catchphrase that officers often use in their tenders, but what does that mean? Is that the best approach? Where do I start? How do I make a plan? What are some best practices? How do I write a good tender?

This **OneUnifiedSystem starter pack** is meant to help the layman officer make sense of IT systems, tech procurement, design principles, and change management; as well as tap on tools and frameworks to set up their modernisation efforts for success.
